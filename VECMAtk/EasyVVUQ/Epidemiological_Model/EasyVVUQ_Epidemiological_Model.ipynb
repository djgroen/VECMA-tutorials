    "In this tutorial we will show you how you can use [EasyVVUQ](https://github.com/UCL-CCS/EasyVVUQ) to investigate the properties of a simple epidemiological model. The model is very simplistic and is not intended to realisticly portray a real epidemic such as COVID-19. However it is also fun enough to experiment with and we can use it as an example to show how you can use EasyVVUQ to answer questions about your scientific models. EasyVVUQ is successfully used by researchers in various different fields, such as plasma physics, weather and air pollution modelling and materials science."

Please note that you might need to restart the runtime after the installation is complete. If the following code examples don't work please try that first. I have added a command that kills the runtime (which causes it to be restarted). But I'm not sure if it will always work."

    "In our model individuals are placed on a two dimensional square grid. During each turn, the individual moves at random one square in one of eight possible directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W or NW). If the individual encounters another individual and that person is ill, the individual will also become sick for a specified number of turns (that number is a parameter to the model). Once ill, the individual cannot become sick anymore and after getting over the disease they will have immunity. Immunity means that this person cannot get infected anymore. The simulation continues until no one is sick. At that point the disease counts as erradicated."
