Please note that this setting is not optimal for our example `beam` code, which is not parallel - in case of such codes single core tasks are perfectly fine. Nevertheless, possibility to define `numCores` and `numNodes` is essential for the proper execution of MPI or OpenMP applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** QCG-PilotJob offers several execution models that try to address differences in a preferred way of execution of MPI programs on clusters. In a default execution model only a single instance of the process is started and a user needs to start his parallel code with a proper command enabling its parallel execution (e.g. mpirun). Other execution models start an MPI program for a user and, depending on a number of available resources, actually invoke many processes. In general it is highly useful to use this specialised modules, as they ensure proper assignment of processes to resources, but their usage can cause some inconveniences for execution of not fully parallelised code. This situation takes place in case of EasyVVUQ where the whole chain of actions is executed as a QCG-PilotJob's task, but not all actions can be run in parallel. Thus, in order to enable differentiation between actions which should be run in parallel and those who should not, the `ExecuteQCGPJ` decorator has been proposed. Consequently, all actions that should be run in parallel need to be wrapped in `ExecuteQCGPJ`. For example, to ensure parallel execution of the previously defined `ExecuteLocal()` action, it should be defined as follows `execute = ExecuteQCGPJ(ExecuteLocal('{}/beam input.json'.format(os.getcwd()))`. \n",
